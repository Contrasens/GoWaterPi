# GoWaterPi
A plant irigation system based on Raspberry Pi, either manual or at scheduled intervals. A submersible water pump is triggered to water some plants. 

On the case there is a switch and three LEDs (red, green and yellow). The red LED light wjen the system is on. The on-on switch sets the functioning to either:
- manual mode (green LED on): when the switch is in this position the water pump goes on,
- auto mode (yellow LED on): when the switch is in this position the water pump is controlled by the schedule of the Raspberry Pi.
